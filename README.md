# hello-world
The requirement of this project was to use python in conjunction with c++ to read text from a grocery list and display a list dsplaying quantity and also display an histogram.
I created functions for each option in the menu. this allows easy fixes if an error was to ever pop up. I would know exactly where to go to fix the bug.
For option 2 and 3 in the program I had to hard code the list the program was processing. This does not allow for easy portability.
The coding that dealt with calling python functions from C++ was the most difficult. I used youtube and the google machine to help answer my questions.
This program is maintainable with the multiple functions that allow easy bg finding base off where the issue occurs on the user side. for example, if i press option 2 and i get an error, i can easily go to the option 2 function in the code. I made sure to comment frequently and leave plenty of whitspace allowing for easy reading. I could have done better on the adaptability when it comes to how the list is called. Like I said earlier, options 2 and 3 used hard coded lists unlike option 1 that asks the user for the name of the list. This is because i kept have issues with that function. I will update once i find the fix.
